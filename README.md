# SnippetBox

This repository is the web application **SnippetBox**, created while working through the book ***Let's Go***,
by *Alex Edwards*.

While the book uses MySQL as its database, this repository uses SQLite. This results in some added code for converting SQLite's datetime strings to Go's time.Time format.
